            <h1>Creative Flow</h1>

            <p style="font-size: large; line-height: 1.5em; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">Suffering from creative block?
                Please do not despair.
                Like many things, it can be coaxed
                With love and tender care.
                First, discard the worry
                And let your mind be clear.
                Leave room for inspiration.
                Make space for fresh ideas.
                Next, reignite your senses;
                Seek out something new.
                Look from different angles.
                Try things you rarely do.
                Research a passion project.
                Follow links that inspire.
                Nurture all glowing embers
                So those sparks can take fire.
                Banish fear and pressure,
                Let your block melt away,
                Then step back into the arena
                And live to create another day.</p>

            <h1>Do Not Stand At My Grave and Weep</h1>
            <h4>By Mary Elizabeth Frye</h4>

            <p style="font-size: large; line-height: 1.5em; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">Do not stand at my grave and Weep
                I am not there. I do not sleep.
                I am a thousand winds that blow.
                I am the diamond glints on snow.
                I am the sunlight on ripened grain.
                I am the gentle autumn rain.
                When you awaken in the morning's 
                hush
                I am the swift uplifting rush
                Of quiet birds in circled flight.
                I am the soft stars that shine at
                night.
                Do not stand at my grave and cry;
                I am not there. I did not die.
            </p>

            <h1>All The King's Horses</h1>
            <h4>By Laurence Overmire </h4>
            <p style="font-size: large; line-height: 1.5em; font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">The world doesn't rhyme anymore

                At least not for me
                I don't want to think in rhyme
                Perfect sounding syllables are so
                
                Rare
                
                The timing no longer iambic
                We backbeat and stutter
                Step syncho
                
                Pated to our mortality
                
                I don't rhyme
                Neither do you
                I swallow the dissonance
                
                In lieu of a finer chord.</p>
